# **_Binary classification and kernel methods in noisy QML_**
## **_Abstract_**

During the last years, the field of quantum computing has evolved significantly. It has
been applied to different domains, seeking the grail of _quantum supremacy_, the turning
point where quantum computers could achieve results that no classical computer could
ever obtain.

In this project, we explore the so-called _”Quantum Machine Learning”_ field, following
the steps of [Havlicek et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11326). We will see how some quantum algorithms can help
achieve quantum supremacy in the simplest _binary classification_ Machine Learning task.
